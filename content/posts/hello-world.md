This is my first post on my new personal website. I built this using Hugo with custom HTML templates and minimal CSS.

The design is inspired by simple, text-focused websites that prioritize content over visual complexity.

I plan to write about:
- Technology and programming
- Personal projects
- Things I'm learning

More posts coming soon.
