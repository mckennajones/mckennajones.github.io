This is my first post here! I've been meaning to do this for quite a while, but better late than never right?

I've been feeling inspired by the mission of companies like [Kagi](kagi.com) to "humanize the web". I also recently watched [this great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZUqa-lTbnU) by [Sophie Koonin](https://localghost.dev). The web has become bloated, and I think personal websites like this can be a great step towards bringing back a part of what made me excited about the internet and technology in the first place as a child.

I'm not exactly sure what I'll put up here yet, but I hope you poke around and find something that interests you. And if not, that's ok too.
